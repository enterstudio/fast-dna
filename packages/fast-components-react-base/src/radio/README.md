# Radio
An element that can be turned on and off. *Radio* buttons are almost always listed together in groups.

## Usage
Only one *radio* within a *radio* group may be selected at a time. Limit the *radio* label to a single line.

## Style guidance
Should not put two radio groups next to each other. When two radio groups are right next to each other, itâ€™s difficult to determine which radios belong to which group. Use group labels to separate them.
